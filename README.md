# files_compress
An app for handling archive files within ownCloud.

Written 2016 by Lars NÃ¦sbye Christensen, DeIC

2016 September: Work continued by Kasper Sort, DeIC

## Dependencies 
 * ownCloud 7.0.x (not tested with newer)

This app adds an Extract function for files with one of the appropriate extensions (zip, gz, tar, bz2), and a Compress function for others. Compression and extraction are handled server-side, using PHP.

These two functions are accessed from the usual list of File Actions.

## Installation instructions
Copy the app to the **owncloud/apps/** directory. Make sure the web server can write to the user directory - this is needed for temporary file management.
